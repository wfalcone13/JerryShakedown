- Game ends when all 3 lives are lost

#### ‚ö° **Power-ups**
- **Invincibility** (Gold): Makes Jerry temporarily immune to obstacles (8 seconds)
- **Double Jump** (Blue): Allows Jerry to jump twice in mid-air (10 seconds)

- **Level 1**: Speed = -4, Note Value = 5
- **Level 2**: Speed = -7, Note Value = 6 (at 300 points)
- **Level 3**: Speed = -10, Note Value = 8 (at 600 points)
- **Level 4**: Speed = -12, Note Value = 10 (at 1000 points)
- Visual level indicator shows current difficulty

#### üéØ **Enhanced Game Mechanics**
- **Improved Physics**: Proper gravity, jumping mechanics, and ground collision
- **Better Collision Detection**: Robust collision system with tolerance for better gameplay
- **Random Object Positioning**: Obstacles and collectibles appear at random heights
- **Smooth Animations**: Visual feedback and power-up effects
- **Enhanced UI**: Lives counter, level indicator, and power-up status display

#### üõ°Ô∏è **Collision System**
- **Enhanced Detection**: Improved collision bounds with tolerance
- **Invincibility System**: Brief invincibility after losing a life
- **Visual Feedback**: Jerry becomes semi-transparent when invincible
- **Debug Logging**: Console logs for collision detection (for development)

### Play
Users can start game with the Enter Key. Pause game with P key. Toggle music with the M key. Users can move the Jerry Figure with the left and right keys and can have Jerry jump with the spacebar. The score will increase until Jerry runs out of lives. Jerry can collect music notes to increase score and power-ups for special abilities. When Jerry hits an obstacle, he loses a life and gets brief invincibility. The game ends when all lives are lost.

### Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Move left and right
- **Spacebar**: Jump (double jump when power-up is active)
- **Enter**: Start game / restart after game over
- **P**: Pause/unpause game
- **M**: Toggle music

### Game Objects

#### üöÆ **Obstacles**
- **Trash Cans**: 75√ó50px, ground level obstacles
- **Traffic Cones**: 50√ó50px, ground level obstacles
- Both move from right to left at varying speeds
- Both cause Jerry to lose a life when hit
- Both respawn with random positions

#### üéµ **Collectibles**
- **Music Notes**: Floating collectibles worth 5-10 points
- **Random Heights**: Appear at various heights (150-300px)
- **Floating Animation**: Gentle up/down movement
- **Progressive Value**: Worth more points at higher levels

- **Invincible Power-up** (Gold): 8-second immunity
- **Double Jump Power-up** (Blue): 10-second double jump ability
- **Speed Boost Power-up** (Green): 6-second speed increase
- **Pulsing Animation**: Visual effect to attract attention
- **Slower Movement**: Move slower than obstacles for easier collection
